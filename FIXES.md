# Bug Fixes - Transaction Saving & Recurring Transactions

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Transaction Saving
The transaction saving functionality was already working correctly, but lacked comprehensive testing.

**Solution:**
- Created unit tests to verify transaction saving functionality
- Tests cover all edge cases including validation, account balance updates, and budget updates

### 2. "Generate Now" Date Logic Bug

**Problem:**
When clicking "Generate Now", users were getting "No pending transactions to generate" even when they had active recurring rules. This happened because:
- The original logic started AFTER the last generated date (or start date) and then advanced forward
- If the start date was today or in the future, the loop condition `while (currentDate < today)` would be FALSE immediately
- No transactions would be generated

**Example of the bug:**
```
Start Date: October 23, 2025 (today)
Loop: while (Oct 23 < Oct 23) = FALSE ❌
Result: No transactions generated!
```

**Solution:**
Rewrote the date generation logic (App.jsx:626-681):
1. Set today to end of day (23:59:59) for inclusive comparison
2. If never generated before, start from the start date (not after it)
3. Changed loop condition from `<` to `<=` to include today
4. Generate transaction FIRST, then advance to next occurrence
5. Properly handles catch-up for missed occurrences

**New behavior:**
- ✅ Generates transaction if start date is today
- ✅ Catches up on all missed occurrences since start date
- ✅ Handles first-time generation correctly
- ✅ Handles subsequent generations correctly

### 3. Recurring Transaction "Generate Now" Missing Account Connection

**Problem:**
When clicking "Generate Now" to create transactions from recurring rules, the generated transactions were not linked to any account. This caused:
- Transactions without account association
- Account balances not being updated
- Data integrity issues

**Root Causes:**
1. Recurring rules didn't have an `account_id` field
2. The recurring rule form didn't include an account selector
3. The `generateTransactionsFromRules` function didn't include `account_id` when creating transactions
4. Account balances were not updated when generating recurring transactions

**Solution:**

#### Code Changes:
1. **Added account_id to recurring rule state** (App.jsx:183-191)
   - Updated initial state to include `account_id: ''`

2. **Added account selector to recurring rule form** (App.jsx:2114-2129)
   - Added dropdown to select which account the recurring rule applies to
   - Marked as required field

3. **Updated handleAddRecurring function** (App.jsx:757-770)
   - Added validation to require `account_id`
   - Included `account_id` when saving rule to database
   - Included `account_id` in formatted rule for local state

4. **Updated generateTransactionsFromRules function** (App.jsx:692-752)
   - Include `account_id` when generating transactions
   - Calculate account balance changes for all affected accounts
   - Update account balances in database after generating transactions

5. **Updated loadDataFromSupabase function** (App.jsx:27-88)
   - Load `account_id` field when fetching transactions
   - Load `account_id` field when fetching recurring rules

#### Database Migration:
Created SQL migration file: `add_account_to_recurring_rules.sql`

**To apply the migration:**
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Run the migration file contents
4. Verify the column was added successfully

**Note:** Existing recurring rules will have NULL account_id and will need to be updated manually or via the UI.

## Testing

### Unit Tests Created
Location: `src/App.test.jsx`

**Test Coverage:**
- Transaction saving with all required fields
- Validation for missing account_id
- Account balance updates after transaction save
- Budget updates for expense transactions
- Recurring transaction generation with account_id
- Account balance updates when generating recurring transactions
- Multiple account handling
- Data loading with account_id fields
- Form validation

### Running Tests

1. **Install test dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install -D vitest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event jsdom
   ```

2. **Run tests:**
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

3. **Run tests with UI:**
   ```bash
   npm run test:ui
   ```

## Files Modified

1. `src/App.jsx`

   - Database migration to add account_id column

2. `src/App.test.jsx`
   - Comprehensive unit tests for transaction functionality

3. `vitest.config.js`
   - Test configuration

4. `FIXES.md` (this file)
   - Documentation of fixes

## Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run database migration in Supabase
- [ ] Create a new recurring rule with account selection
- [ ] Verify the account is saved with the recurring rule
- [ ] Click "Generate Now" button
- [ ] Verify transactions are created with correct account_id
- [ ] Verify account balances are updated correctly
- [ ] Create a manual transaction and verify it saves properly
- [ ] Run automated tests: `npm test`

## Next Steps

1. Apply the database migration
2. Test the changes in development environment
3. Update existing recurring rules to include account associations
4. Deploy to production when ready
